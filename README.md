## 📊 Key Features

### Newton-Raphson Implementation

✅ **From First Principles:**
- Y-bus matrix constructed from branch data
- Full Jacobian matrix (J1, J2, J3, J4) computed analytically
- No built-in load flow solvers used

✅ **Assignment Requirements:**
- Flat start initialization (1.0∠0° for PQ buses)
- Bus classification (Slack, PV, PQ)
- Iteration-by-iteration tracking
- 2nd iteration output captured
- Line-by-line comments
- Flowchart reference with line numbers

✅ **Detailed Output:**
- Bus voltages (magnitude and angle)
- Power injections at all buses
- Line power flows (both directions)
- Total system losses
- Convergence statistics

### Task 2: Comparison Framework

Compares three methods on:
- **Numerical Accuracy:** Voltage differences (< 0.001 pu tolerance)
- **Convergence:** Iterations and computation time
- **System Losses:** P and Q losses
- **Discussion:** Reasons for deviations

### Task 3: Sensitivity Analysis

For each load bus (5, 6, 8):
- Varies P and Q by -10%, 0%, +10% (9 scenarios each)
- Records voltage magnitudes at all buses
- Calculates variance and standard deviation
- Identifies most influential load
- Statistical analysis with rankings

## 📐 Algorithm Details

### Newton-Raphson Method

**Equation:** J · Δx = Δf

Where:
- J = Jacobian matrix [J1, J2; J3, J4]
- Δx = [Δδ; Δ|V|] (angle and magnitude corrections)
- Δf = [ΔP; ΔQ] (power mismatches)

**Convergence:** Quadratic (typically 3-5 iterations)

**Tolerance:** 1e-4 pu

### Gauss-Seidel Method

**Update:** V_i^(k+1) = (1/Y_ii) · [(S_i*/V_i*) - Σ Y_ij · V_j]

**Convergence:** Linear (slower, ~50-100 iterations)

### Fast Decoupled Method

**Decoupling:** P-θ and Q-V equations solved separately

**Approximations:**
- B' ≈ -Im(Y) for P-θ
- B'' ≈ -Im(Y) for Q-V

**Convergence:** Between NR and GS

## 📈 Expected Results

### Convergence Comparison
| Method | Iterations | Time (typical) |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Newton-Raphson | 3-5 | < 0.01 s |
| Gauss-Seidel | 50-100 | 0.01-0.02 s |
| Fast Decoupled | 4-7 | < 0.01 s |

### Voltage Ranges
- All buses: 0.95 - 1.05 pu (typical)
- Slack/PV buses: Controlled
- PQ buses: Dependent on loads

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** ModuleNotFoundError
```bash
# Solution: Install required packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

**Issue:** Import errors between files
```bash
# Solution: Ensure all .py files are in same directory
# Check Python path if needed
```

**Issue:** Convergence failure
- Check input data format
- Verify flat start initialization
- Increase max_iter if needed
